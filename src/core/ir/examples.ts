/**
 * The guides' own worked examples, as finished prompt text.
 *
 * MiniMax teaches this format almost entirely by worked example: four Cases in
 * the base guide, one complete example in the ref guide, one per mode. These
 * are those five, reproduced byte for byte.
 *
 * They live in `src/` rather than in `test/` because the planner prompt shows
 * one of them to the model -- the prompt had 2,500 words of rules and no
 * instance of the artifact those rules describe. Everything that reads them
 * reads this file: the mode blocks in `provider/prompts/planner.ts`, the
 * serializer round-trip in `test/serialize.test.ts`, and the byte-exactness
 * check in `test/guide-fidelity.test.ts`, which compares them to the guide
 * files on disk. One copy, three readers, and the strongest of the three
 * bindings is the one against the vendor's own text.
 *
 * Do not edit these to match the serializer. They are the vendor's output and
 * the serializer is what has to agree with them; `test/serialize.test.ts`
 * asserts that direction, and if it fails the serializer is wrong.
 *
 * The documents these render from are in `test/fixtures/`, which is the right
 * home for them -- nothing in `src/` needs a parsed H3Document of a guide
 * example, only the text.

export const t2vaBakerExpected = `integrated_multimodal_description: [Shot 1] Live-action, cinematic, a medium-wide shot frames a baker opening the shutters of a small street bakery before sunrise. The camera pushes in with small amplitude at slow speed as the middle-aged baker with a calm, slightly raspy voice (S1) places a fresh loaf on the wooden counter and says: <d>[English] First batch of the morning.</d> [Shot 2] At 00:05.000, the camera cuts to a close-up of steam rising from the sliced bread while the baker's final words carry over from the previous shot.

overall_soundscape: Wooden shutters scrape open over a quiet street as trays clink softly inside the bakery. The doorbell rings once, followed by light footsteps and the crisp sound of bread being sliced.

Her reflection moves across the glass while the quiet, breathy young woman (S1) says: <d>[English] I get off at the next station.</d> She folds the letter along its existing crease.

Water rolls from the expanding fabric while she steps beneath it, rotates the handle into the final angle, and settles into the pose, spacing, and composition established by Picture 2 at the end of the shot.

integrated_multimodal_description: [Shot 1] Live-action, cinematic, a close shot begins with an intact drinking glass near the edge of a dark wooden table, while the same hand and sleeve visible in <Picture 1> approach from the right. The camera pushes in with small amplitude at slow speed as the fingertips strike the rim. The glass tips, falls, and hits the floor with a sharp impact; cracks spread through it as fragments slide outward.

[reference generation + audio reference] The target video shows <Subject 3> eating a cookie in <Subject 1>. <Subject 4> enters with <Subject 2>, which lunges toward the cookie. The three-shot exchange uses <Audio 1> as the voice-timbre reference for <Subject 3> and ends with a canned audience laugh.

retention_analysis:
<Subject 1> (appears in [Shot 1], [Shot 2], [Shot 3]): fully_preserved - the exposed brick wall, orange tufted sofa, patterned pillows, neon sign, and wooden coffee table are retained.
<Subject 2> (appears in [Shot 1], [Shot 2]): fully_preserved - the Samoyed's thick white fur, pointed ears, dark nose, and curved tail are retained.
<Subject 3> (appears in [Shot 1], [Shot 2], [Shot 3]): fully_preserved - the blonde woman's identity, long hair, and light-pink shirt are retained.
<Subject 4> (appears in [Shot 1], [Shot 2]): fully_preserved - the young man's short wavy brown hair and dark-grey hoodie are retained.
<Audio 1>: reference - its vocal timbre guides the dialogue delivery of <Subject 3> without copying the original signal.

detailed_description:
The target video uses a realistic multi-camera sitcom style with warm indoor lighting.
[Shot 1] A medium shot establishes <Subject 1>, the coffee shop with its exposed brick wall, orange tufted sofa, patterned pillows, neon sign, and wooden coffee table. <Subject 3> (S1), the young woman with long blonde hair and a light-pink button-down shirt with rolled-up sleeves, sits on the sofa holding a chocolate-chip cookie. From the left, <Subject 4>, the young man with short wavy brown hair and a dark-grey hoodie with drawstrings, enters holding the leash of <Subject 2>, the thick-furred white Samoyed with pointed ears, a dark nose, and a curved tail. The dog lunges toward the cookie and pulls the leash taut. <Subject 3> (S1) jerks her hand back and, using the clear youthful voice timbre referenced from <Audio 1>, exclaims with light annoyance, <d>[English] Hey! Watch your dog!</d> She closes her lips and guards the cookie while <Subject 4> pulls the dog back.
[Shot 2] At 00:03.000, the shot cuts to a close-up of <Subject 4> (S2), the young man in the dark-grey hoodie from Shot 1, sitting beside <Subject 3> on the sofa and holding <Subject 2> securely in his arms. <Subject 4> (S2) says in a casual young male voice with a playful tone and an easy conversational pace, <d>[English] He just likes cookies more than me.</d> He closes his mouth into an apologetic smile and strokes the dog's thick white fur.
[Shot 3] At 00:05.000, the shot cuts to a close-up of <Subject 3> (S1), the blonde woman in the light-pink shirt from Shot 1. Her annoyance softens as she looks toward the Samoyed. <Subject 3> (S1) replies in the same clear youthful voice referenced from <Audio 1> with an amused cadence, <d>[English] Well, he has good taste at least.</d> She smiles and raises the cookie in a small toast-like gesture. A classic canned audience laugh begins immediately after the line and continues through the final frame.

overall_soundscape:
Soft indoor coffee-shop room tone continues throughout the scene.
